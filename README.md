- A loop to allow multiple rounds of play  
- A simple score tracking system *(optional)*

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to choose between:
   - Stone 🪨
   - Paper 📄
   - Scissors ✂️

2. The computer randomly picks one of the three.

3. The winner is decided based on traditional rules:
   - Stone crushes Scissors
   - Scissors cuts Paper
   - Paper covers Stone

4. The result is displayed (Win, Lose, or Draw).

5. Optionally, the game continues for multiple rounds with score tracking.
